# finding-orbi-final
A React JS web application that helps university students in search of potential group mates.

**Motivation**

During this pandemic, online platforms have become the main learning tools used in our education system. This has led to many students struggling to interact with their coursemates as face to face interaction is at an all time low. Simple tasks such as finding suitable group mates are becoming an issue as students do not know their coursemates well enough. As a student, a common platform to interact with my coursemates is crucial to ensure that everyone is able to adjust and fit into university life. We believe that an effective web application will be able to bridge the gap that online learning has caused.

**Aim**

We aim to allow students to connect better through this web application and to enhance and ease their learning experience by alleviating the barrier that online education has caused.


**User Stories**

As a student who has mostly online lessons and has little interaction with my coursemates, I would want to be able to find compatible groupmates that I can work with for projects easily. 

As a student who wants to have a good profile for a better chance of finding groupmates, I would strive to be a good groupmate for good reviews on my profile.


The Web-Application provides a search and chat-like interface for students to find and communicate with other coursemates to become compatible groupmates.
